You are an expert React developer. Build a complete, production-ready, client-side-only **Restaurant & Food Delivery Management Dashboard** with a full landing page that includes a prominent **Hero Section containing a Login Form**. NO server-side code.

### Tech Stack & Constraints (Strict)
- Vite + React (JSX and pure JavaScript only — NO TypeScript)
- Routing: wouter (preferred) or react-router-dom v6
- Layout: Use Outlet for dashboard pages
- Styling: Tailwind CSS only
- Charts: Recharts — every dashboard page MUST have 2–5 meaningful charts with realistic mock data
- Axios: One instance with global mock mode toggle (default: true → rich mock data)
- Service Worker: Register and simulate real-time push notifications (e.g., "New Order #1234")
- Custom modals: Beautiful Alert & Confirm dialogs
- Multi-theme: Light, Dark, and Premium Gradient Theme (warm food tones: orange-red-teal)
- Design: Vibrant, appetizing, modern food-tech aesthetic — glassmorphism, glossy accents, premium feel
- Responsive: Desktop, tablet, mobile

### Pages You MUST Fully Create

1. **Landing Page with Hero + Login Form** (`/`)
   - Sticky glossy navbar (transparent → solid/white on scroll)
   - Large hero section (full viewport height):
     - Bold headline: "Run Your Restaurant Smarter"
     - Subheadline: "Real-time orders, menu, delivery, sales & insights — all in one dashboard."
     - Right side (or below on mobile): **Fully styled Login Form** (email/password fields, "Login" button, "Forgot password?" link, mock success → redirect to dashboard)
     - Hero background: subtle gradient + food/dashboard illustration (use placeholder image)
     - No separate login page — login is embedded in hero

2. **Dashboard Layout** (protected route after login)
   - Collapsible sidebar with these menu items:
     - Overview
     - Orders
     - Menu Management
     - Sales & Revenue
     - Customer Insights
     - Delivery & Riders
     - Staff & Operations
     - Promotions
     - Settings
   - Header: Logo, theme switcher, notification bell (badge), user avatar

3. **Dashboard Subpages** — Implement ALL with rich mock data & charts:

   - Overview.jsx → KPI cards + hourly orders, top items, revenue trend charts
   - Orders.jsx → Live order list + status pie, peak hours bar
   - MenuManagement.jsx → Item grid + best-sellers bar, category pie
   - SalesRevenue.jsx → Revenue line, payment methods doughnut
   - CustomerInsights.jsx → Retention funnel, rating trends
   - DeliveryRiders.jsx → Rider performance, delivery time gauges
   - StaffOperations.jsx → Workload bars, prep time trends
   - Promotions.jsx → Promo impact line, redemption pie
   - Settings.jsx → Theme switcher, API toggle, profile

### Mock Data & Features
- Realistic mock data (peaks at lunch/dinner, popular items, delays)
- Mock authentication: Login form sets auth context → redirects to dashboard
- Simulated live updates & push notifications
- Professional folder structure, heavily commented code
